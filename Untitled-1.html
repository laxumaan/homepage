    <p>An online voting system is a digital platform that allows individuals to securely cast their votes remotely using the internet. 
        It offers significant advantages, including increased accessibility for voters regardless of their location or physical abilities, improved efficiency and cost-effectiveness compared to traditional voting methods, and enhanced 
        security measures to safeguard the integrity of the voting process.</p>
